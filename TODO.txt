Package: Honeyd-Viz
Version: 0.3
Author: ikoniaris
Website: bruteforce.gr/honeyd-viz


TODO for new versions:
+ Seperate HTML and PHP where possible, tidy up code!
+ Graphs (.png) creation should be moved to xxx-generator for each component (or all in one!)
+ Use new version of QGoogleVisualAPI and generate more graphs (eg GeoMap instead of IntensityMap?)
+ Include sample Apache configuration (unless uploaded to /var/www/)
+ Add MySQL dump/backup function (security risk?)
+ Option to use local/offline geolocation service and not geoplugin, see: https://www.maxmind.com/app/support


DONE:
+ Initial version release!
+ Clean honeyd-viz-generator from kippo queries
+ Move project to sf.net/googlecode.com/github.com (next milestone version)
